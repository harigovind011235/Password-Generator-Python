# Password-Generator-Python
this is a simple password generator coded in python just using the random module.

1 => imported the module random

2 => stored some strings,numbers,digits and other symbols in 4 varibles to be included in the password

3 => created 4 boolean values and assigned them as true.these are created for more control over password like what we need to include above set of different variables.

4 => since all the 4 boolean is true every string set will be concantinated to the empty string variable 'aall'.

5 => varibale 'length' is set to decide the length of the password and variable 'amount' is set to decide the number of passwords to be generated.

6 => we iterate through the value inside the 'amount' and each time we join a random sample from the 'aall' of a fixed length to the variable password and print the password.
